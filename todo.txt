[x] opaqueBackground bounds grow 1 or 2px right and bottom when I change colorTransform
    render bounds does not change. must be a slight glitch in context not resetting.
    only happens in canvas mode when opaquebackground is drawn by canvas.
[x] opaquebackground in opengl mode is slightly incorrect (slightly too small for rotated bounds?)
[-] defaultTextFormat - setting after setting text in flash does not change text format - difference between openfl, hopwever openfl is much more intuitive and less shit.
[x] colortransfrom fix unnecessary colorTransform bitmapdata operation in canvas / cairo, multipliers often get stuck at 0.999999999999 in the render pipeline, assume  > 0.9999 equates to 1
[x] added BeginShaderFill matrix support for canvas / cairo
[x] opaqueBackground cairo not right
[-] neko cannnot render ✓ or ✗
[x] cairo spinning radial gradient hittest messes up due to scale + rotation?
[x] draw opaquebackground is messing up on windows gl, rotated object draws evaluated bounds of rotation, not rotated bounds.
[x] need to make graphics __bounds calculate on demand, and make it so getBounds() and getRect() differ.
[x] opaqueBackground better pixel precision (always + 1 width & height)
[x] sprites with mask, hitTest not working in software mode, must be some path reset not being called which messes up the hitTest?
[?] DisplayObject.mask GLRenderer blanks entire screen when no rotation?
[x] evenodd fills not cancelling out, always adding onto the last. Check if this is what flash does. (seems correct)
    Does mean inconsistency between GL and Software modes, GL does not acknowledge EVENODD winding, enabled by default for Flash.
[x] masks as single path2Ds, integrate graphics renderMask() into render()
    cairo + canvas, new var mask:Bool, check true for strokes and fills like hitTest
[x] test pixelRatios
[-] interesting bug in flash, opaqueBackground + miterjoints + right angle triangle, background overdraws left and bottom sides by some strange amount. opaqueBackground is messed up in flash!
[x] gl drawEllipse w/ negative scale has only 6 polygon points!

[ ] colortransform affecting child opaqueBackgrounds in canvas mode (not gl).
    colortransform in software mode causes displayobjectcontainer to be cacheasbitmap = true effectively.
    can lead to big inefficiencies, if the container consists of 2 dots spaced apart, mostly blank pixels. also the colortransform is applied to the container in 1 big go. Apply colortransform to each shape / bitmap individually. Also helps with opaquebackground.
[ ] consider '__boundsVisual' for Graphics too, because we could lineto a bunch and create a path but it has no actual visible bounds.
[ ] some kind of warning / error when scale9Grid is set outside of bounds of graphics?
[ ] FlashGraphics.hx uses drawTriangles for drawQuads, not great. Just use paths?
    public static function drawQuads(graphics:Graphics, rects:Vector<Float>, indices:Vector<Int>, transforms:Vector<Float>):Void
[ ] check filters, did some stuff to opaqueBackground logic in renderer need to test.
[ ] alpha masks + cacheasbitmap

[ ] applying transform.colorTransform on object with mask does not invalidate the image.
[ ] applying transform.colorTransform on shaderFill does nothing too.
